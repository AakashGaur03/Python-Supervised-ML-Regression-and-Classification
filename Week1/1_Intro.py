# Supervised Learning
# Maps an Input X to Output Label Y
# Learns from being given "right answers"

# Types Regression ,classification
# Regression : Predict any number out of infinitely many possible outcomes

# Classification : Predict out of limited data (predict categories not necessarily numbers)
# Small number of possible outcomes


# Unsupervised Learning
# Data comes with only Input X And no output labels Y
# we are given data that is not associated with any output data that is label Y
# No one is there to supervise the data, Data  learns on its own , patterns ,structures that might be in the data


# Clustering Algorithm
# When Algorithm is able to place the unlabeled Data into differnet clusters
# Group similar data points togther

# Anomaly Detection
# Find unusual data points

# Dimensionality Reduction
# Take a big data set and let us magically compress it
# Compress data using fewer numbers losing as little info as possible
