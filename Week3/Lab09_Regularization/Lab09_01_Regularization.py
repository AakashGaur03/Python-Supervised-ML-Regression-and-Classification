# In regularized linear regression (e.g., Ridge/L2):
# 
#   Cost: J(w) = MSE + λ * sum(w_j^2)
#
# - λ controls the regularization strength.
# - Increasing λ penalizes large weights more.
# - This causes weights w1, w2, ..., wn to shrink.
# - Helps prevent overfitting by simplifying the model.

# Regularization is a machine learning technique used to prevent overfitting and improve a model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data
